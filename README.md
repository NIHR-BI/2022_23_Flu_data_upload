## How does the data get cleaned and saved in GitHub?

- There is a recurring trigger for this to automatically happen in GitHub Actions. [England trigger](https://github.com/SallySamNIHR/Flu_data_upload/actions/workflows/flu_england.yml) and [Wales trigger](https://github.com/SallySamNIHR/Flu_data_upload/actions/workflows/flu_wales.yml).
- Each trigger triggers the code to run in its respective yml files stored in the [.github/workflows folder](https://github.com/SallySamNIHR/Flu_data_upload/tree/main/.github/workflows).
- As part of the yml code, they run respective .py code. This .py code contains Python code which extracts the data from the link, cleans it and then saves it as a csv. [England .py code](https://github.com/SallySamNIHR/Flu_data_upload/blob/main/flu_england.py) and [Wales .py code](https://github.com/SallySamNIHR/Flu_data_upload/blob/main/flu_wales.py)
